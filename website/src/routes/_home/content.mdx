Welcome to the Schema Benchmarks project. This aims to compare the performance of different schema validation libraries in detail, including separating each step of the process.

## Benchmarks

Steps benchmarked include:

### <Link to="/initialization">Initialization</Link>

Creating the schema itself. This is usually a one time cost.

```ts data-title="schemas.ts"
import * as v from "valibot";

export const personSchema = v.object({
  name: v.string(),
  age: v.number(),
});
export type Person = v.InferOutput<typeof personSchema>;
```

### <Link to="/validation">Validation</Link>

Checking if a given value matches the schema. Crucially, this is different to <Link to="#parsing">parsing</Link> because it doesn't return a new value.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";
import { personSchema } from "./schemas";

if (v.is(personSchema, data)) {
  // data is narrowed to Person
}
```

> Some libraries only support validation (e.g. `ajv`) _or_ parsing (e.g. `zod`).
> In these cases, we categorise them accordingly.

### <Link to="/parsing">Parsing</Link>

Checking if a given value matches the schema, **and** returning a new value. This will include any transformations.

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";
import { personSchema } from "./schemas";

const person = v.parse(personSchema, data);
// person is of type Person
```

As well as running runtime tests, we test the bundle size of each library. This is important for browser usage, where this will affect download time.
